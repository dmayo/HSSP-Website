    <h3>Van de Graaff generator!</h3>
    <img src="img/vandegraaff_small.jpg" style="float:right;padding-left:4px;"/>
    <p>
    To reinforce the course content, you will be building an electrostatic motor and a Van de
    Graaff generator. These two devices utilize many of the concepts we cover in this class for
    operation. To make sure that each of you is familiar with the function of these two devices.
    </p>

    <p>
    We ask that you submit a one-page report summarizing how an electrostatic motor and a
    Van de Graaff generator work on or before A date which will be filled in here.
    Instead of providing you with a step-by-step instruction, we will leave it up to you to
    search the Internet and gather ideas for construction for the electrostatic motor. The Van
    de Graaff generator comes out of a kit. There are no restrictions on the electrostatic

    <h3>Night Light Circuit!</h3>
    <p>
    To emphasize and apply your understanding of basic series and parallel circuits, you will be creating an automatic nightlight using a small solderless breadboard, LEDs, and a photoresistor. Pre-cut wires and resistors will also be provided. To ensure that everyone understands how their project will work, we will ask that you submit a schematic of your proposed nightlight circuit by a date which we will specify one week in advance. There is no right or wrong implementation of the nightlight so long as it is automatic, meaning it turns itself ononly in darkness, so creativity will be highly encouraged (surprise us, or ask us for ideas!). We will provide a steady 5-volt DC power source for the nightlight in class; this should be kept in mind as you design the circuit. Outside of class, you will also be able to power the nightlight using three AA or AAA batteries.
